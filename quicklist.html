				        		<p>I'm a music junkie. I've had been using Spotify for a long time, but Fall and Winter of my Sophomore year I got really in to SoundCloud. The content was radically different from any other streaming source, and the social-ish aspects of it were really appealing to me as I started exploring new genres of music. However, this presented a problem. <strong> Constantly swithcing back and forth between Spotify, YouTube and SoundCloud to hear different content was really impractical. </strong> Whenever friends would come over and recommend songs, I'd always awkwardly pick the wrong streaming service and just not be able to find the music. From this, the idea of one central single page application that aggregated music from a variety of streaming services was born, and I called it QitUp (Queue it up).</p>

				        			<p>I started with the simplest design possible. An omni-search bar that supported instant search over SoundCloud and YouTube (the Spotify API has some strange licensing issues so we ditched that pretty early on), and a queue of songs with player controls. I was initially looking for a </p>

				        			<p>Learning Objective-C was a cool experience, and I wanted to make sure that all of the interactions were smooth and made sense before putting effort into the aesthetic. Eventually my head was moving faster than I could code, and I started putting together mocks using Sketch and InVision so I could more quickly iterate and figure out how to build the best experience for Split!</p>

				        		<div>
				        			<p>After several iterations, I felt that I had designed an experience that let users effortlessly break down checks, split them up and clearly understand all of the information associated with the participants and payments in each transaction. I designed support for OCR and Venmo integration and was very happy with the finished prototype -- it felt like a product that could offer a delightful experience when I needed it, serve it's purpose and be out of the way in a flash.</p>

				        		<p>Although we never really put time into building a production-ready version of Split! once school started it was a great design exercise for me that summer as I was just beginning my adventure into the Product Design major at Stanford. I learned a lot about how iterative of a process design is, some Objective-C and most importantly to always focus on the end user. I'm hoping to actually turn this design into a function app in Swift when I take CS193P (iPhone Application Programming) during Winter 2016. </p>
