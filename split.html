				        		<p>While out to dinner several times during Summer 2014, I thought a lot about how annoying splitting checks among friends can be. I had just started using <a href="https://venmo.com/" target="_blank" style="target-new: tab;"> Venmo </a> and <strong>saw an opportunity to make the process of splitting a check way easier. </strong> My friend and roommate at the time Gary and I decided to try our hand at learning Objective-C and building out our idea.</p>

				        			<p>It needed to be fast, simple and clutter free. Early drawings of Split! introduced me to some of the challenges that come along with mobile: lworking with very little screen real estate and while needing to communicate a lot of information, reduced context, relying on gestures and a plethora of other considerations.</p>

				        		<div>
				        			<p>Learning Objective-C was a cool experience, and I wanted to make sure that all of the interactions were smooth and made sense before putting effort into the aesthetic. Eventually my head was moving faster than I could code, and I started putting together mocks using Sketch and InVision so I could more quickly iterate and figure out how to build the best experience for Split!</p>

				        		<div>
				        			<p>After several iterations, I felt that I had designed an experience that let users effortlessly break down checks, split them up and clearly understand all of the information associated with the participants and payments in each transaction. I designed support for OCR and Venmo integration and was very happy with the finished prototype -- it felt like a product that could offer a delightful experience when I needed it, serve it's purpose and be out of the way in a flash.</p>

				        		<p>Although we never really put time into building a production-ready version of Split! once school started it was a great design exercise for me that summer as I was just beginning my adventure into the Product Design major at Stanford. I learned a lot about how iterative of a process design is, some Objective-C and most importantly to always focus on the end user. I'm hoping to actually turn this design into a function app in Swift when I take CS193P (iPhone Application Programming) during Winter 2016. </p>
